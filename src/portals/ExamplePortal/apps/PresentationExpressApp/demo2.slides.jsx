// TODO: Include notes for Git-based persistent storage; [possible] FUSE-mounted storage backend
// TODO: Include reference where Linus Torvalds mentions git is like a filesystem: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git: "In many ways you can just see git as a filesystemâ€”it's content-addressable, and it has a notion of versioning, but I really designed it coming at the problem from the viewpoint of a filesystem person (hey, kernels is what I do), and I actually have absolutely zero interest in creating a traditional SCM system.")
// TODO: Clarify how a web browser, itself, is like an operating system, and ReShell is just a frontend to that (rebuttal for Guido's "do you imagine every website will its own operating system")
// TODO: Demonstrate application profiling (try to squeeze in a Graph this week)
// TODO: "It's not a question of 'if', but 'when'"
